	•	Users will input property details (purchase price, market value, rent, expenses, etc.).
	•	The system will calculate and display the cap rate based on user inputs.
	•	Optionally, users can compare cap rates based on purchase price and market value.

2. Business Objectives

	2.	Enhance decision-making for real estate investors by allowing comparisons of different scenarios.
	3.	Provide an easy-to-use interface that requires minimal financial knowledge.
	4.	Ensure accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.
	5.	Potential future enhancements: User account creation, saving calculations, and advanced financial modeling.

3. Functional Requirements

￼
	•	Based on market value (if provided):
￼

3.3 Output & Display

	•	Display a simple summary of key financial metrics.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance: Results should be calculated instantly upon user input.
	•	User Experience: Simple, clean UI with easy-to-understand labels and tooltips.
	•	Accessibility: Mobile-friendly, responsive design.
	•	Security: No user-sensitive data storage; all calculations happen on the client-side.
